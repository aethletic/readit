### Installation

The installation is very hard and not every Jedi can handle it.

First, let's copy the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aethletic/readit.git as readit
```

Let's go to the folder we just downloaded:

```bash
cd readit
```

Install the required packages using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
composer install
```

Now let's go to the public folder of the project:

```bash
cd public
```

And let's start the test server:

```bash
php -S localhost:1337
```

You can now open our test site [`localhost:1337`](http://localhost:1337) in a browser and see this page ðŸ¥³

Uff, it was really hard!

What? Nothing works..? Um... Then you better take the alternatives.
